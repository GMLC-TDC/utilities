## Used Libraries or Code
### [HELICS](https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS)  
Some of the original code for this library was pulled from use inside HELICS.  It was pulled out as the utility libraries are not core to HELICS and it was useful as a standalone library so it could have better testing and separation of concerns.  HELICS now uses the utilities library instead of maintaining its own code.  HELICS is released with a BSD-3-Clause license.

### [GridDyn](https://github.com/LLNL/GridDyn)
Some of the original functions were pulled from GridDyn.  It was pulled out as the utility libraries are not core to GridDyn and it was useful as a standalone library so it could have better testing and separation of concerns.  GridDyn now uses the utilities library instead of maintaining its own code. GridDyn is released with a BSD-3-Clause license.

### [googleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)  
  The tests are written to use google test and mock frameworks and is pulled in as a subproject via git clone or CMake FetchContent.  Googletest is released with a BSD-3-clause licensed

### cmake scripts
Several cmake scripts came from other sources and were either used or modified for use in HELICS.
-   Lars Bilke [CodeCoverage.cmake](https://github.com/bilke/cmake-modules/blob/master/CodeCoverage.cmake)
-   CLI11 [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11)  while CLI11 was not used directly many of the CI scripts and structure were borrowed to set up the CI builds.
